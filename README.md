### Data decentralization is becoming a must
*Why is this project useful?*

Now-days advertisement has created the need to track every step and turn of everybody's actions in the internet. Although for some people this is not a problem, for some of us is a reason to mistrust social networks like Facebook and other public services as YouTube.

Also, data-centralization and ad-centered services creates the need for this companies to  manage it's contents and prevent some of it to be shared. Although some content shouldn't be shared for moral reasons, this argument has justified the attack on freedom of speech this companies have made.


### To give everybody the responsibility and freedom of their content
*How will this be achieved?*

Creating a WordPress-like web application that anybody can download and host in their own server that can replace the need of any of the now-day's most popular social networks. This self-host website can access and share information to be able to connect to other websites like it to re-create things like Facebook Wall, or 'Recently Uploaded Videos' of Youtube though a subscription-like method that basically retrieves another websites content through it's API.


### Your very own social net-ship
